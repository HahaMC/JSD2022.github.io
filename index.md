## Journées Scientifiques des Doctorants SPI 2022

<img align="center" width="531" height="470" src="INP.JPG">

Welcome to Journées Scientifiques des Doctorants SPI 2022. This annual meeting is an opportunity to discover the various thesis topics within our doctoral school, to exchange with other PhD students working on the same topics as you (or topics that arouse your curiosity) and, perhaps, to lead to collaborations and/or friendships. Several speakers will be invited during these two days: some of them will present the possible career perspectives after a PhD. We will reveal more about the program soon! The participation of Ph.D students to these two days is mandatory. It is part of the requirement for obtaining your doctoral degree.

3.**Can I make many slides for the presentation?**

After consultation, we finally decided to allow the possibility of making several slides for the 3 minutes presentation.

4.**I am not in Clermont-Ferrand, can I make my presentation remotely?**

It is strongly recommended to come in person to make your presentation and discuss with other people around your poster. It is also an opportunity to meet other PhD students in a friendly environment and to discover our beautiful region of Clermont-Ferrand! However, the doctoral school does not finance transportation and accommodation costs (unless you are based abroad, in which case you should contact us).

5.**I am in my first year and I do not have any results. Can I still participate?**

Absolutely, we even recommend participating in the first year. Remember that one of the goals of the Scientific Days is to have an overview of the thesis topics within the doctoral school to encourage exchange.
