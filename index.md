## Journées Scientifiques des Doctorants SPI 2022

<img align="center" width="531" height="470" src="INP.JPG">

Welcome to Journées Scientifiques des Doctorants SPI 2022. This annual meeting is an opportunity to discover the various thesis topics within our doctoral school, to exchange with other PhD students working on the same topics as you (or topics that arouse your curiosity) and, perhaps, to lead to collaborations and/or friendships. Several speakers will be invited during these two days: some of them will present the possible career perspectives after a PhD. We will reveal more about the program soon! The participation of Ph.D students to these two days is mandatory. It is part of the requirement for obtaining your doctoral degree. 

## Pre-Register
We are inviting you to complete the [survey](https://framaforms.org/participation-aux-journees-scientifiques-des-doctorants-1652653658)

### FAQ

**1.Can I make many slides for the presentation?**

After consultation, we finally decided to allow the possibility of making several slides for the 3 minutes presentation.

**2.I am not in Clermont-Ferrand, can I make my presentation remotely?**

It is strongly recommended to come in person to make your presentation and discuss with other people around your poster. It is also an opportunity to meet other PhD students in a friendly environment and to discover our beautiful region of Clermont-Ferrand! However, the doctoral school does not finance transportation and accommodation costs (unless you are based abroad, in which case you should contact us).

**3.I am in my first year and I do not have any results. Can I still participate?**

Absolutely, we even recommend participating in the first year. Remember that one of the goals of the Scientific Days is to have an overview of the thesis topics within the doctoral school to encourage exchange. You can find examples at the following link to help you make your [Poster](https://spi.ed.uca.fr/inscription-obligations/obligations/journee-scientifique-de-led-spi)

**4.Will there be prizes?**
Yes! We are planning to give prizes for the best poster and the best presentation. To be eligible for the best presentation prize, you must not exceed 3 minute presentation ;)
