### FAQ
1.Mandatory elements on the poster
The poster must indicate the funding organization and the mention "Ecole Doctorale des Sciences pour l'Ingénieur". The logo of Clermont Auvergne INP UCA must also appear (see attachment).

2.Poster printing
We are in charge of printing the posters: the poster must be sent to us before June 6th, otherwise you will have to print the poster at your own expense. You may or may not use the templates that were provided in the original email, the only condition being that the format is A0.

3.Can I make many slides for the presentation?
After consultation, we finally decided to allow the possibility of making several slides for the 3 minutes presentation.

4.I am not in Clermont-Ferrand, can I make my presentation remotely?
It is strongly recommended to come in person to make your presentation and discuss with other people around your poster. It is also an opportunity to meet other PhD students in a friendly environment and to discover our beautiful region of Clermont-Ferrand!
However, the doctoral school does not finance transportation and accommodation costs (unless you are based abroad, in which case you should contact us).

5.I am in my first year and I do not have any results. Can I still participate?
Absolutely, we even recommend participating in the first year. Remember that one of the goals of the Scientific Days is to have an overview of the thesis topics within the doctoral school to encourage exchange. You can find examples at the following link to help you make your poster: https://spi.ed.uca.fr/inscription-obligations/obligations/journee-scientifique-de-led-spi 

6.Will there be prizes?

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JSD2022/JSD2022/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
