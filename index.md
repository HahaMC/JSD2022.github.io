# Welcome to Journées Scientifiques des Doctorants SPI
This annual meeting is an opportunity to discover the various thesis topics within our doctoral school, to exchange with other PhD students working on the same topics as you (or topics that arouse your curiosity) and, perhaps, to lead to collaborations and/or friendships. Several speakers will be invited during these two days: some of them will present the possible career perspectives after a PhD. We will reveal more about the program when it is finalized!The participation of Ph.D students to these days is mandatory: it is part of the requirements for obtaining your doctoral degree.

### FAQ
1.Mandatory elements on the poster
The poster must indicate the funding organization and the mention "Ecole Doctorale des Sciences pour l'Ingénieur". The logo of Clermont Auvergne INP UCA must also appear (see attachment).

2.Poster printing
We are in charge of printing the posters: the poster must be sent to us before June 6th, otherwise you will have to print the poster at your own expense. You may or may not use the templates that were provided in the original email, the only condition being that the format is A0.

3.Can I make many slides for the presentation?
After consultation, we finally decided to allow the possibility of making several slides for the 3 minutes presentation.

4.I am not in Clermont-Ferrand, can I make my presentation remotely?
It is strongly recommended to come in person to make your presentation and discuss with other people around your poster. It is also an opportunity to meet other PhD students in a friendly environment and to discover our beautiful region of Clermont-Ferrand!
However, the doctoral school does not finance transportation and accommodation costs (unless you are based abroad, in which case you should contact us).

5.I am in my first year and I do not have any results. Can I still participate?
Absolutely, we even recommend participating in the first year. Remember that one of the goals of the Scientific Days is to have an overview of the thesis topics within the doctoral school to encourage exchange. You can find examples at the following link to help you make your poster: https://spi.ed.uca.fr/inscription-obligations/obligations/journee-scientifique-de-led-spi 

6.Will there be prizes?
